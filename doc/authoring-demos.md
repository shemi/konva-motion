# Authoring docs demos

Every live demo in the documentation is a real composition that runs in the
`<smoove-player>` web component and is shown as source from the *same file* — one
source of truth, no copy-paste drift.

## The contract

A demo is a single file:

```
packages/docs/src/demos/<name>.ts
```

whose **default export is a `Composition`** (a `() => Composition` factory —
sync or async — also works; the player's `resolveComposition` unwraps it).

```ts
// packages/docs/src/demos/<name>.ts
import { Composition, Rect, Sequence } from "@konva-motion/core";

const comp = new Composition({
  id: "<name>",
  fps: 60, // all demos run at 60fps
  durationInFrames: 120, // 2 seconds at 60fps
  width: 1280,
  height: 720,
  loop: true, // loop so the embedded player replays
});

const main = new Sequence({ from: 0, durationInFrames: 120 });
main.add(new Rect({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 1280, height: 720, fill: "#0d1117" }));
// …build the scene; drive attributes from the frame via main.register(...)…
comp.add(main);

export default comp;
```

That's it — no registry to edit, no manual wiring.

Prefer the core drawing wrappers (`Rect`, `Circle`, `Text`, `Image`, `Flex`,
`Block`, …) over raw `Konva.*`. They render the same but participate in flex
layout, so a demo can reflow without hand-positioning. Reach for `Konva.*` only
for something core doesn't wrap.

## Embedding it in a page

In any `.mdx` page, reference the demo by its file name:

```mdx
<Demo name="<name>" />
```

`<Demo>` ([src/components/demo.tsx](../packages/docs/src/components/demo.tsx))
resolves two views of the file from its name via `import.meta.glob`:

- the served **`?url`** module the `<smoove-player src=…>` dynamically `import()`s at
  runtime (the same path a genuinely remote composition takes), and
- the **`?raw`** source string behind the "View source" toggle.

Optional props: `lang` (code-block language, default `"ts"`), `label` (caption
text), and `src`/`source` to override the resolved values for a composition that
lives outside `src/demos/`.

An unknown `name` throws at render with the list of available demos, so a typo
fails loudly instead of rendering an empty player.

## Assets (images, video, audio)

Demos that need local media import it from a sibling `assets/` folder:

```
packages/docs/src/demos/assets/<file>
```

```ts
import clipUrl from "./assets/sync-test-1.mp4";
import musicUrl from "./assets/music-a.mp3";
```

Because the demo is emitted as its own `?url` chunk, Vite rewrites these imports
to served URLs that resolve when the player loads the module. `.mp4`/`.mp3`/
`.wav`/image imports are typed via `vite/client` (already in the docs tsconfig).

## Conventions & gotchas

- **60fps.** Use `fps: 60`. Size `durationInFrames` and any frame anchors /
  `interpolate` ranges for 60fps (e.g. a 5s demo is `300` frames, not `150`). If
  a page shows the demo's code inline, keep that copy in sync with the file.
- **Prefer core wrappers over raw `Konva.*`** (see above).
- **Layer order = add order.** A `Sequence` is a Konva layer; later-added
  sequences paint on top. Add a full-canvas background `Sequence` **first** so it
  sits under the content, not over it.
- **Updating `Text` content:** the core `Text` wrapper extends `Konva.Group`, so
  change its text with `node.setText("…")` — it has no Konva `.text()` setter.
- **Growing a flex leaf:** `FlexShape.width(n)` sets the flex *size value*, not
  the rendered width, and won't visibly resize a leaf from an updater. To make a
  child fill space use `flexGrow` (or a `%` width) and let the layout reflow;
  animate the container's `width`/`gap` via `setAttrs`.

## Checklist

- [ ] File at `packages/docs/src/demos/<name>.ts`, default-exports a `Composition`.
- [ ] `fps: 60`, and `loop: true` so the embedded player replays.
- [ ] Scene built from core wrappers (raw `Konva.*` only where core has no wrapper).
- [ ] Any media lives under `src/demos/assets/` and is imported relatively.
- [ ] Page embeds it with `<Demo name="<name>" />`.
